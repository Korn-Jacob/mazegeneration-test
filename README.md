# Maze Generation Test
This is my first attempt at maze generation and at graph theory algorithms in general (using randomized DFS), with a demo in flask.

You can see a demo [here](https://mazegeneration-test.onrender.com/), or install it for some reason by cloning the repository, running `demo.py`, then going to `localhost:5000`
